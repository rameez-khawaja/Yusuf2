            <h2>Birth and exile</h2>
            <p>Yusuf was the first son of Muhammad V of Granada (r. 1354–1359 and 1362–1391), and the only one born during the first of the sultan's two reigns. Although his date of birth is unknown, historian Francisco Vidal Castro estimated that he was born c. 757 AH or 1356 CE (a few years after his father's accession). Yusuf was about three years old when his father was dethroned on 23 August 1359; a group of men under Muhammad el Bermejo (later Muhammad VI) scaled the walls of the Alhambra that night and enthroned the sultan's half-brother, Ismail II. Yusuf was walking with his father in the Generalife gardens (Jannat al-‘Arīf) just outside the Alhambra complex; this allowed the sultan to escape to Guadix in the eastern part of the emirate before going into exile across the Mediterranean Sea to Fez, the capital of Morocco's Marinid Sultanate. Yusuf was left in Granada, but around 25 November the new sultan allowed him and his mother to join the dethroned sultan in Fez.</p>

            <h2>Rule and family</h2>
            <p>Yusuf II took the throne on 15 January 1391 (10 Safar 793 AH), the day of his father's death, and adopted the laqab (regnal honorific) of al-Mustaghni bi-llah ("He who is satisfied with God"). He sent a letter that day to Alonso Yáñez de Fajardo, the Castilian adelantado of Murcia, confirming the continuation of the truce which Muhammad V had signed with John I in 1390. Although bilateral treaties typically expired on the death of either signatory, the 1390 treaty remained in effect because both successors – Yusuf and Henry III (r. 1390–1406) – had also signed it. Yusuf maintained peace with Aragon, whose King John I had had good relations with Muhammad V. In March 1391, Yusuf sent the Aragonese king a letter notifying John of his father's death and his enthronement; the king replied with the customary condolences, expressing surprise at the sultan's delay in sending the letter.</p>

            <h2>Death</h2>
            <p>Yusuf died on 5 October 1392 (16 Dhu al-Qa'da 794 AH), aged about 36. The later Castilian Chronicle of John II alleges that he was killed by a poisoned tunic (aljuba) which was among gifts sent by the Marinid Sultan Abu al-Abbas. The allegation was based on a letter by Fernán Sánchez, a Christian who lived in the emirate, during the reign of Yusuf III (r. 1408–1417). Sánchez wrote that he "saw with [his] own eyes" in Granada that the sultan felt unwell immediately after putting on the tunic and "died within thirty days, with his flesh coming off in pieces". No other sources corroborate the story and, since Sánchez wrote many similar accounts of assassinations with poisoned clothing, historian L. P. Harvey says that "one is reluctant to accept the report as true". Another historian, Francisco Vidal Castro, writes that despite the "fantastic" (and possibly altered) detail, assassination by poisoning is plausible. According to Vidal Castro, the Marinid Sultanate is known to have interfered in Granada's affairs; the sultan's son and successor, Muhammad VII, may have conspired with the Marinids or other courtiers to poison his father and seize the throne.</p>
